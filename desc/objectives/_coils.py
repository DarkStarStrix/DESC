    Parameters
    ----------
    coil : CoilSet or Coil
        Coil for which the data keys will be optimized.
    data_keys : list of str
        data keys that will be optimized when this class is inherited.
    target : float, ndarray, optional
        Target value(s) of the objective. Only used if bounds is None.
        Must be broadcastable to Objective.dim_f.
    bounds : tuple of float, ndarray, optional
        Lower and upper bounds on the objective. Overrides target.
        Both bounds must be broadcastable to to Objective.dim_f
    weight : float, ndarray, optional
        Weighting to apply to the Objective, relative to other Objectives.
        Must be broadcastable to to Objective.dim_f
    normalize : bool, optional
        Whether to compute the error in physical units or non-dimensionalize.
    normalize_target : bool, optional
        Whether target and bounds should be normalized before comparing to computed
        values. If `normalize` is `True` and the target is in physical units,
        this should also be set to True.
        be set to True.
    loss_function : {None, 'mean', 'min', 'max'}, optional
        Loss function to apply to the objective values once computed. This loss function
        is called on the raw compute value, before any shifting, scaling, or
        normalization. Note: Has no effect for this objective.
    deriv_mode : {"auto", "fwd", "rev"}
        Specify how to compute jacobian matrix, either forward mode or reverse mode AD.
        "auto" selects forward or reverse mode based on the size of the input and output
        of the objective. Has no effect on self.grad or self.hess which always use
        reverse mode and forward over reverse mode respectively.
    grid : Grid, list, optional
        Collocation grid containing the nodes to evaluate at. If list, has to adhere to
        Objective.dim_f
    name : str, optional
        Name of the objective function.
