### pass list
* DShape
* Solovev

### fail list, see ./logs.
* Heliotron: Flux surfaces are no longer nested.
* ESTELL: Flux surfaces are no longer nested.
* WISTELL-A: Flux surfaces are no longer nested.
WISTELL-A and ESTELL are vacuum cases. I know this is a bad test for tokamaks, but I think it's ok for stellarators.
